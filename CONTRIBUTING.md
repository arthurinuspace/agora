# ü§ù Contributing to Agora

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Agora as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arthurinuspace/agora.git
   cd agora
   ```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov black flake8 mypy

# Set up pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### SOLID Principles

Agora follows SOLID architecture principles. When contributing:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Service Layer Pattern

```python
# ‚úÖ Correct: Use dependency injection
from services import get_service, PollRepository

poll_repo = get_service(PollRepository)
polls = poll_repo.get_polls(team_id="T123")

# ‚ùå Incorrect: Direct instantiation
from services.implementations import SQLAlchemyPollRepository
poll_repo = SQLAlchemyPollRepository(db_service)
```

### Strategy Pattern Usage

When adding new validation or export functionality:

```python
# Add new validation strategy
from strategies.validation import ValidationStrategy

class CustomValidationStrategy(ValidationStrategy):
    def validate(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[ValidationResult]:
        # Implementation here
        pass

# Register in validation context
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Categories (All Required)

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions
3. **Error Handling Tests**: Test various error scenarios
4. **Performance Tests**: Test critical performance metrics
5. **SOLID Compliance Tests**: Ensure architectural principles

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest test_enhanced_*.py -v
python -m pytest test_integration_*.py -v

# Run with coverage (minimum 80% required)
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=80

# Run SOLID architecture validation
python -c "
from services import ServiceContainer, configure_services
container = ServiceContainer()
configure_services(container)
print('‚úÖ SOLID architecture validated')
"
```

### Writing Tests

Every new feature must include:

```python
# Unit tests for the feature
def test_feature_functionality():
    # Test normal operation
    pass

def test_feature_error_handling():
    # Test error scenarios
    pass

def test_feature_edge_cases():
    # Test boundary conditions
    pass

# Integration tests
def test_feature_integration():
    # Test with other services
    pass
```

## üíª Code Style

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format code with Black
black .

# Check style with flake8
flake8 .

# Type checking with mypy
mypy .
```

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any
from datetime import datetime

def create_poll(
    question: str,
    options: List[str],
    team_id: str,
    user_id: str,
    is_multiple_choice: bool = False,
    expires_at: Optional[datetime] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Create a new poll with the specified parameters.
    
    Args:
        question: The poll question
        options: List of poll options
        team_id: Slack team ID
        user_id: User creating the poll
        is_multiple_choice: Whether multiple selections are allowed
        expires_at: Optional expiration time
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing poll data
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If question or options are invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```
